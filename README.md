# BIMSA
I commenced the BIMSA Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence program on November 14, 2025. This repository documents my academic progress and daily life since the program's commencement. I extend my gratitude to Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture and the Beijing Yanqi Lake Institute of Applied Mathematics for their support and assistance.
